      <mat-card-title>The basisc about me:</mat-card-title>
      <mat-card-content>I appreciate you taking the time to learn more about me. My name is Valencia, but I prefer V or Wolf. My pronouns are she/her and they/them. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I have been working professionally in tech for 9 years. I live and work in the NYC metro area. When I'm not working, you will find me gaming, hanging out with friends and family, writing creatively or working on my personal growth. I love animals, laughter, and listening to people talk about what they're passionate about. I prefer to work alone in my typical day-to-day, but I welcome collaboration within my team and across teams, the opportunity to mentor Jr. QA Engineers, and I'm never afraid to ask for help or clarification when I need it.

      <mat-card-title>What I've done in the past:</mat-card-title>
      <mat-card-content>I began my career at Valtira, a company that I interned at while working on my undergraduate degree. The role title was "Cloud Developer", but really, the work I did was as a Full-Stack Engineer, with a heavy emphasis on front-end development creating websites for various clients. From there, I moved across the country and began working as a Software Development Engineer in Test at a company called TubeMogul. I learned a lot in both roles and I realized I wanted to have more flexibility with where I worked so I after a little over a year at TubeMogul, I decided to become a freelancer. I continued building websites and I built a QA bootcamp where I trained folks without any tech experience to be testers. They worked on the websites I created to give them real world experience in QA. As a freelancer, I had a lot more flexibility whith my schedule and location, but I found myself spending a lot more time managing projects and doing accounting than actually doing the work I enjoyed. I decided I needed a change and that lead me to Aclaimant, where I spent four years building my career in QA. In that time, I leveraged my the leadership and QA skills I'd been cultivating to get promoted into management.

      <mat-card-title>What I do now:</mat-card-title>
      <mat-card-content>While I was working at Aclaimant, I was approached about a contracting position with a company called Collabralink (now Groundswell). I ended up taking the role. After contracting with them for a while, they ended up offering me a permanent position and I moved forward with it.Currently I am a Lead QA Engineer and Capability Manager. Since my current company is split into multiple projects, I am a Lead QA Engineer on my specific project, but the people I manage span across projects. I am most passionate about growing my leadership and QA skills.
